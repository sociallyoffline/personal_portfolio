    <!-- Algebraic Equation Section -->
    <h2 id="lesson1" class="section-title">Algebraic Equation</h2>
    <p><span class="important">Algebraic equation</span>, statement of the equality of two expressions formulated by applying a set of variables. The algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Examples are: 
        <span class="example">x<sup>2</sup> + 1</span> and 
        <span class="example">(x<sup>2</sup> + 2x - y)/(x - 1) = 12</span>.</p>
    <p>An important special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressed in the form <span class="example">ax<sup>n</sup> + bx<sup>n-1</sup> + ... + gx + h = k</span>. They have as many solutions as their degree (<i>n</i>), and the search for their solutions stimulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra.</p>
    <p>Equations like <span class="example">x sin(x)</span> that involve nonalgebraic operations, such as logarithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.</p>

    <!-- Chemical Compound Section -->
    <h2 id="lesson2" class="section-title">Chemical Compound</h2>
    <p>A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically bonded chemical elements, with a fixed ratio determining the composition.</p>
    <p>The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.</p>
    <p>For example, water (<span class="example">H<sub>2</sub>O</span>) is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.</p>
    <p>The atoms within a compound can be held together by a variety of interactions, ranging from covalent bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds.</p>
    <p>A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond (as in H<sub>2</sub>) and ionic bonds. For example, <span class="example">H<sub>2</sub>O</span> is held together by polar covalent bonds.</p>
    <p>Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.</p>
